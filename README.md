# ![A pixelart image of a plant](resources/icon.ico) my webpage

this is the repository of my little website. I made it in november 2024 to teach myself some webdevelopment basics and I tried to opt for performance and loading times.

# ðŸ“’ learnings

working with html, css, javascript, basic understandings of how a static website works and how to set one up, how to optimise a website for performance

# ðŸ”œ future

over the time I will propably add some blogposts, and new tools. there is no real plan or a todolist. I will just add things if I create them and I like them
